<div class="exmoor">
<p><strong>Exmoor</strong> is loosely defined as an area of hilly open moorland in west Somerset and north Devon in South West England. It is named after the River Exe. Exmoor has long acted as inspiration for writers, artists and poets. From the Romantics like Shelley and Coleridge who loved to walk the moorland paths to RD Blackmore who did much to raise the profile of Exmoor through his famous novel "Lorna Doone" and more recently the writings of Hope Bourne.</p>
<p><strong>Dartmouth</strong> is a town and civil parish in the English county of Devon. It is a tourist destination set on the western bank of the estuary of the River Dart, which is a long narrow tidal ria that runs inland as far as Totnes. Dartmouth is a great spot for family holidays, there are plenty of local attractions in and around the town that are perfect for keeping children amused and of course, many of the trails and activities that take place around the town and the river are all suitable for all the family.</p>
<p><strong>Exeter</strong> is an ancient city on the River Exe in southwest England. Dating back to the Roman era, the Exeter City Walls surround its centre and Gothic Exeter Cathedral. Exeter Castle, a Norman landmark, overlooks leafy Northernhay and Rougemont Gardens. To their west, the Royal Albert Memorial Museum & Art Gallery (RAMM) displays fine art and costumes. The vaulted, medieval Underground Passages snake beneath the city.</p>
<p><strong>Plymouth</strong> is a port city in Devon, southwest England. It’s known for its maritime heritage and historic Barbican district with narrow, cobbled streets. Sutton Harbour is home to the National Marine Aquarium, where sharks and rays glide in a deep tank. Also in the harbour are several marinas and a fish market, the Plymouth Fisheries. The Mayflower Steps are where the Pilgrim Fathers set sail for the New World in 1620</p>
